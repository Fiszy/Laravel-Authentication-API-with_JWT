Authentication API laravel with JWT

-composer update

-php artisan migrate
-php artisan key:generate
-php artisan jwt:secret;
-php artisan key:serve


## User Registration
You need to download Postman software to make a test with it

. With Postman, and while the test server is running, send a test POST request to the following url: http://localhost:8000/api/auth/register.  Its body should include name, email, and password key/value parameters in a json string. Use whatever values you like for this test user, just remember them as weâ€™ll use them in the next part of this walk through when we authenticate this test user.

## Login

In Postman, send a request to http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login.  Send email and password key/value pairs, w/values corresponding to the test user created .
